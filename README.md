# Java-Gui-Fibonacci
Iterative vs recursive Implementation

![](https://github.com/m00s77/Java-Gui-Fibonacci/blob/main/images/guiFibonacci.png)


This simple application has only one class, contains 3 methods and a single constructor. This class extends the JFrame and implements ActionListener.

The main objective is to visualize the difference between iterative and "normal" recursive mode, in performance and memory.

Of course, there are several other alternatives but that was not the idea.

It was a nice example to work with recursive methods, JComboBox, JRadioButton and ButtonGroup.
